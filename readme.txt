Adds Featured Images before the content, in the Jetpack Mobile theme

== Description ==

Adds Featured Images before the content, in the Jetpack Mobile theme

Important: for this plugin to work, you must activate [Jetpack](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/) first, and activate the Mobile Theme module.

By default, this plugin only adds Featured Images on the home page. If you want to display them on the Post pages as well, go to the Jetpack Menu, and click on "Configure" under the Mobile Theme module. You will be able to enable Featured Images on Posts pages from there. 

This plugin is a work in progress. You can report issues [here](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/jetpack-mobile-theme-featured-images), or submit a pull request [on GitHub](https://github.com/jeherve/jp-minileven-featured).
